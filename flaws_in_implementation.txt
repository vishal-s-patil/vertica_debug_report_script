1. func replace_tables_in_query does not work for complex queries
    ->it replaces all the live tables with all the respective backup tables
    ->in scenarios where joins include between live and backup tables occur 
      this func fails.
    ->fix: find a intelligent way to replace only necessary table names

2. replace_thresholds
    -> Does not work if queries has more than one case when conditons
    -> it can have more than one case when conditons in same column but multiple columns are not supported.
