1. func replace_tables_in_query does not work for complex queries
    ->it replaces all the live tables with all the respective backup tables
    ->in scenarios where joins include between live and backup tables occur 
      this func fails.
    ->fix: find a intelligent way to replace only necessary table names

2. replace_thresholds
    -> Does not work if queries has more than one case when conditons
    -> it can have more than one case when conditons in same column but multiple columns are not supported.

3. Duration and issue_time:
    -> When issue_time is not passed script queries from live tables and not from backup table, so even if duration is passed as 10 hours it shows result for whateven is present in the live table.
